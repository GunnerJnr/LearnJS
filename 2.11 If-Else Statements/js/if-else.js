Would the if statement above execute:

If someValue is false? NO
If someValue is true? YES
If someValue is null? NO
If someValue is undefined? NO
If someValue is 0? NO
If someValue is -1? YES
If someValue is ''? NO
If someValue is 'has a value!'? YES
If someValue is {}? YES
If someValue is { isHavingFun: true }? YES
If someValue is []? YES
